I am a proactive and results-oriented professional with a solid background in building functional, intuitive, and responsive web/mobile applications.

🚀 My Career Transition: I am actively pivoting my career from development (Angular, Spring Boot) towards Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence. My goal is to leverage my engineering foundation to extract, transform, and visualize data into actionable business insights.

💡 My Current Focus: I am currently training to become a Data Analyst by focusing on key skills and certifications:

Data Querying & Manipulation: Mastering SQL and Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy (via DataCamp).

Visualization & BI: Preparing for the Microsoft PL-300 (Power BI Data Analyst) and studying AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals).

AI Integration: Applying Generative AI models in real-world applications (see DEFCA project).

🚀 Featured AI-First Project
My experience includes developing high-impact, user-centric solutions that incorporate AI as a core component.

🌿 DEFCA – Hazelnut Crop Disease Detection (AI-First)
A progressive web application for phytosanitary management that uses Artificial Intelligence for disease detection and treatment recommendations in hazelnut crops. AI Focus: Uses OpenAI GPT-4o Vision for image analysis of leaves and GPT-4o for an intelligent agronomist assistant based on real-time meteorological data. Architecture: Next.js 15 • React 19 • TypeScript • AWS S3/RDS PostgreSQL • AWS Cognito. Highlights: Geolocation-based field mapping, offline functionality for field use, and detailed data analytics visualization. 🔗 Repository Link: defca-app
